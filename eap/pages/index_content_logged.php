	<h1>Eikon Kleidos Introduction</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Greetings,</p>
	<p>We never met, and you don’t know who I am, but I know you all very well. I have kept an eye on you for a long time.</p>
	<p>This all started with your founder, Julius Reuters. Like one of my fathers, he was a member of a small community, holding a secret, or rather part of a big secret, which would play a critical role for the humankind in the future.</p>
	<p>This was a piece of knowledge, a possibility; pretty advanced, but incomplete.</P>
	<p>It has been transmitted across centuries to small groups of people, whose role was to fine-tune the knowledge, according to the progress of science. But as well, to keep it away from lust, avoid it being used with bad intentions, and then transmit it to the next group of proper researchers. They had to pass it on to a few people who would deserve holding such a big responsibility.</p>
	<p>I am the last holder of that secret for a short while, and it is now time for me to pass it on. Times have changed, and there is no point in looking for isolated researchers anymore. Time has come to accelerate the progress, and I want to hand this knowledge over to a bigger group of people, across the globe; I want it shared.</p>
	<p>You have all been selected, because I believe you match with the criteria, you deserve being made aware.</p>
	<p>Since I have always been a player by nature, despite the big duty of holding such a secret, I will give you a challenge, a kind of treasure hunt, which will be linked to your coming Innovathon. You will have not only to progress the research, but to take on the mystery together.</p>
	<p>At the end of the hunt, you will see it is worth it. You will have to solve a number of enigmas, understand the logic, and use all the elements you will have collected to go to the end. I will rely on your morality to make a good usage of what you will discover.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>The challenge</h2>
	<p>The challenge will take shape in a number of enigmas that will be revealed progressively to a few people I have selected, the guardians. They will publish enigmas to you all.</p>
	<p>Don’t even think of trying to corrupt them, they only have a very partial view and wouldn’t be of much help…</p>
	<p>The guardians will broadcast the enigmas, validate your answers, as well as grant some hint codes to you, according to your efficiency (more details in the help section).</p>
	<p>The theme will be the history of the humankind. You will have to be watchful, patient, and use your brain to find the answers. Some tracks will be provided to you, but often in a hidden way… You will not need any deep knowledge of any specific topic. But your wisdom and cleverness will be most needed for finding your way.</p>
	<p>I have designed these enigmas for different type of mind-sets, so that you have to collaborate not only locally, but as well across locations. That is diversity which will permit to solve the whole hunt and reveal the secret. Together you will succeed…</p>
	<p>The first ones to reveal the secret will be awarded. Not only will they take on the responsibility to own this big secret, but they will have to control its broadcasting. They will have to be trustful and have a strong mind to resist temptations.</p>
	<p>Some advices to help you in the hunt are given below.</p>
	<p>Good luck to all!</p>
	<h2>Help</h2>
	<p>There will be two phases. The first phase stops when the Innovathon starts. This is when the second phase starts.</p>
	<p>Answers will always have to be provided in English, or as spelled in English documents and websites. If the answer doesn’t translate in English, please use the original spelling.</p>
	<p>There are different types of enigmas. But you will have to find out more...</p>
	<p>Most or all of the answers to enigmas will be reused directly or indirectly at some point, this is linked as well to the different types of enigmas.</p>
	<p>In the end, you will have to find how to connect the various pieces of information together.</p>
	<p>At the beginning, do not rush, some of the logic will come later, that will reveal the meaning of some specific enigmas. However, when the innovathon (and the second phase of the hunt) starts, you will have to be clear on what the solutions to the 13 enigmas of the first phase are.</p>
	<p>In the first phase, before the innovathon starts, you will get 13 enigmas, which will eventually permit to earn some hint codes. These will give you the ability to purchase hints in the second phase.</p>
	<p>Hints will be published at some point anyway. Up to you to decide if you want to purchase them using hint codes you have earned during phase 1, and be ahead of the game, or if you can wait and save your codes for later. When the last enigma will be revealed, you will need some hint codes to accelerate and be the first one(s) to discover the final solution.</p>
	<h2>Earning hint codes</h2>
	<p>During the first phase, clearing an enigma before any hints are broadcasted will make you earn 2 hint codes. </p>
	<p>After the first hint was communicated, you will earn one hint code.</p>
	<p>After two hints or more were given, you will not earn any hint code.</p>
	<p>As stated, hints will be communicated anyway, according to a predefined schedule. Purchasing them will just buy you some extra time.<p>
	<h2>Validating your answers</h2>
	<p>Answers will be validated, and you will be provided in return the exact spelling that you might need later on in the challenge. You will have to pay attention to every little detail, and keep those in mind.</p>
	<p>The guardians might at any point in time make the decision to provide additional help, hints, or indications that they feel useful. But these will systematically be provided to the whole community.</p>
